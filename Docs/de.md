- Custom log generator development

## 📊 Metrics
- Logs processed: 1,000+
- Detection rules created: 5
- Dashboards built: 3
🎯 GitHub Best Practices for Your Project
1. Use GitHub Issues for Project Management
Create issues for each week's tasks

Use labels: week-1, bug, enhancement, documentation

Assign issues to track progress

2. Leverage GitHub Wiki
Detailed technical documentation

Step-by-step tutorials

Troubleshooting guides

3. Version Control Everything
Configuration files

Detection rules

Documentation updates

Docker configurations

4. Use Branches Effectively
bash
main                    # Production-ready code
├── week-1-foundation   # Current week development
├── week-2-data         # Future week preparation
└── hotfix-*           # Critical fixes
5. Commit Message Standards
text
feat: Add brute force detection rule
fix: Resolve Elasticsearch memory issue
docs: Update Week 1 progress documentation
config: Optimize Docker Compose for production
📈 Documentation Automation
Create a simple script to auto-generate documentation:

python
# scripts/update-docs.py
import os
from datetime import datetime

def update_progress(week_num, completed_tasks):
    """Auto-update weekly progress documentation"""
    filename = f"docs/weekly-progress/week-{week_num:02d}.md"
    # Auto-generate progress reports
    pass

def generate_metrics():
    """Generate project metrics for README"""
    # Count files, commits, etc.
    pass
🔐 Security Considerations for Documentation
No sensitive credentials in public repositories

Use environment variables for configuration

Include security warnings in README

Document security best practices

This structure will help you:

Track progress systematically

Demonstrate professional project management

Build a portfolio piece employers will value

Enable collaboration with others

Document lessons learned for future reference
